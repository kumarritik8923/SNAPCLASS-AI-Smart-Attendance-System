# SnapClass: AI-Powered Smart Attendance System

[![Streamlit App](https://static.streamlit.io/badges/streamlit_badge_black_white.svg)](https://snapclassaismartattendancesystem.streamlit.app/)

## Overview
**SnapClass** is a full-stack, multi-modal Artificial Intelligence application designed to eliminate the friction of manual attendance tracking in educational institutions. By leveraging advanced Computer Vision (Facial Recognition) and Natural Language Processing (Zero-Shot Voice Cloning), SnapClass allows educators to mark attendance for an entire classroom instantly using group photos or continuous audio streams. 

Built with a modular, component-based architecture, it features distinct portals for Teachers and Students, secure cloud database integration, and real-time analytics.

## ✨ Key Features

### AI-Based Group Attendance
- Detects and recognizes multiple students from a single classroom/group image.
- Eliminates sequential biometric attendance marking.
- Automates attendance workflow.

### Face Recognition Authentication
- Student login using facial recognition.
- Face embeddings generated using deep learning techniques.
- Automatic identification of registered users.

### Optional Voice Verification
- Voice embedding support for additional biometric verification.
- Can be used as a secondary authentication layer.

### QR-Based Course Enrollment
- Quick enrollment into subjects using QR codes.
- Reduces manual enrollment overhead.

### Attendance Dashboard
- Subject-wise attendance tracking.
- Total vs attended lectures visualization.
- Interactive student dashboard.

### Real-Time Registration
- New users can register directly through camera input.
- Automatic profile creation using biometric data.

## 🔄 System Workflow

The following flowchart illustrates the core lifecycle of an attendance session:
```text
[Teacher Creates Subject] ---> Generates QR Code/Join Link
                                      |
                                      v
[Student Registers] ---------> Scans QR Code ---> [Enrolled in Subject]
(Face + Voice Saved)
                                      |
                                      v
[Teacher Initiates Class] ---> Uploads Group Photo(s) OR Records Audio
